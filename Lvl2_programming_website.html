      <h2>Why I admire him</h2>
      <div class="body-text">
        <p>I personally admire Bill Gates for multiple reasons. One is because of the huge contribution he has made to the tech and PC industry with his company micorsoft.
          I also admire him because of the amazing work him and his wife Melinda Gates had done with the Gates Foundation, in donating to various charities, and causes.
          They recently donated $100 million to help with efforts to combat the new strain of Coronovirus.</p>
